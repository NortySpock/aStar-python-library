The aStar Python library is our attempt to put together a performant and convenient A* (and possibly others) pathing tool that can be included easily in the Megaminer AI tournament.

To get started, run main.py and it should print out a map with an attempt to find a path from A to B on it. 

The path_util.py file contains a collection of functions that make up some pathfinding tools. It's not well organized yet.

The test_util.py file contains functions that support the testing of the pathfinding tools -- things like generating a random map or printing out the map with the selected path on it.

Python 2.7 is used because MegaMinerAI uses Python 2.7 (mostly due to Twisted being on 2.7). Indentation is non-standard because it mimics the coding style of AI.py in the client for the MegaMinerAI tournament.
